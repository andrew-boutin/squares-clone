# Squares Clone

A [Squares 2](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/games/squares2) clone using `Python3` and [PyGame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html).

Black and red blocks move across the screen at varying speeds. The object of the game is for the player to collect black squares with their cursor. They gain points and their cursor size increases. If the player hits a red square the game ends. The speed of all the blocks increases as the game progresses. It's a very simple but addicting game.
